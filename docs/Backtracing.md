# Backtracing support in Swift

When things go wrong, it's always useful to be able to get a backtrace
showing where the problem occurred in your program.

Broadly speaking there are three circumstances where you might want a
backtrace, namely:

-   Program crashes
-   Runtime errors
-   Specific user-defined program events

Historically, Swift has tended to lean on operating system crash
catching support for the first two of these, and hasn't really provided
any built-in support for the latter. This is fine for Darwin, where the
operating system provides a comprehensive system-wide crash catching
facility; it's just about OK on Windows, which also has system-wide
crash logging; but it isn't great elsewhere, in particular on Linux
where a lot of server-side Swift programs currently rely on a separate
package to provide them with some level of backtrace support when errors
happen.

## What does Swift now support?

Swift now supports:

-   Automatic crash catching and backtrace generation out of the box.
-   Built-in symbolication.
-   A choice of unwind algorithms, including "fast", DWARF and SEH.
-   Interactive(!) crash/runtime error catching.

Crash catching is enabled by default, and won't interfere with any
system-wide crash reporters you might be using.

## How do I configure backtracing?

There is an environment variable, `SWIFT_BACKTRACE`, that can be used to
configure Swift's crash catching and backtracing support. The variable
should contain a `,`-separated list of `key=value` pairs. Supported keys
are as follows:

| Key              | Default  |  Meaning                                                                               |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| enable           | yes[^*]  | Set to `no` to disable crash catching, or `tty` to enable only if stdin is a terminal. |
| demangle         | yes      | Set to `no` to disable demangling.                                                     |
| interactive      | tty      | Set to `no` to disable interaction, or `yes` to enable always.                         |
| color            | tty      | Set to `yes` to enable always, or `no` to disable. Uses ANSI escape sequences.         |
| timeout          | 30s      | Time to wait for interaction when a crash occurs. Setting this to `none` or `0s` will disable interaction. |
| unwind           | auto     | Specifies which unwind algorithm to use. `auto` means to choose appropriately for the platform. Other options are `fast`, which does a na√Øve stack walk; and `precise`, which uses exception handling data to perform an unwind. |
| preset           | auto     | Specifies which set of preset formatting options to use. Options are `friendly`, `medium` or `full`. `auto` means to use `friendly` if interactive, and `full` otherwise. |
| sanitize         | preset   | If `yes`, we will try to process paths to remove PII. Exact behaviour is platform dependent. |
| threads          | preset   | Options are `all` to show backtraces for every thread, or `crashed` to show only the crashing thread. |
| registers        | preset   | Options are `none`, `all` or `crashed`.                                                |
| images           | preset   | Options are `none`, `all`, or `mentioned`, which only displays images mentioned in a backtrace.
| limit            | 64       | Limits the length of the captured backtrace. See below for a discussion of its behaviour. Can be set to `none` to mean no limit. |
| top              | 16       | Specify a minimum number of frames to capture from the top of the stack. See below for more. |
| cache            | yes      | Set to `no` to disable symbol caching. This only has effect on platforms that have a symbol cache that can be controlled by the runtime. |
| swift-backtrace  |            | If specified, gives the full path to the swift-backtrace binary to use for crashes. Otherwise, Swift will locate the binary relative to the runtime library, or using `SWIFT_ROOT`. |

[^*]: On macOS, this defaults to `tty` rather than `yes`.

## Backtrace limits

The limit settings are provided both to prevent runaway backtraces and
to allow for a sensible backtrace to be produced even when a function
has blown the stack through excessive recursion.

Typically in the latter case you want to capture some frames at the top
of the stack so that you can see how the recursion was entered, and the
frames at the bottom of the stack where the actual fault occurred.

1.  There are `limit` or fewer frames. In this case we will display all
    the frames in the backtrace. Note that this \_[includes]() the case
    where there are exactly `limit` frames.
2.  There are more than `limit` frames.
    *  `top` is `0`. We will display the first `limit - 1` frames
        followed by `...` to indicate that more frames exist.
    *  `top` is less than `limit - 1`. We will display
        `limit - 1 - top` frames from the bottom of the stack, then a
        `...`, then `top` frames from the top of the stack.
    *  `top` is greater or equal to `limit - 1`. We will display `...`,
        followed by `limit - 1` frames from the top of the stack.

For example, let's say we have a stack containing 10 frames numbered
here 1 to 10, with 10 being the innermost frame. With `limit` set to 5,
you would see:

    10
    9
    8
    7
    ...

With `limit` set to 5 and `top` to 2, you would instead see:

    10
    9
    ...
    2
    1

And with `limit` set to 5 and `top` to 4 or above, you would see:

    ...
    4
    3
    2
    1

## What is the swift-backtrace binary?

`swift-backtrace` is a program that gets invoked when your program
crashes. We do this because when a program crashes, it is potentially in
an invalid state and there is very little that is safe for us to do. By
executing an external helper program, we ensure that we do not interfere
with the way the program was going to crash (so that system-wide crash
catchers will still generate the correct information), and we are also
able to use any functionality we need to generate a decent backtrace,
including symbolication (which might in general require memory
allocation, fetching and reading remote files and so on).

You shouldn't try to run `swift-backtrace` yourself; it has unusual
requirements, which vary from platform to platform. Instead, it will be
triggered automatically by the runtime.

## System specifics

### macOS

On macOS, we catch crashes and other events using a signal handler. At
time of writing, this is installed for the following signals:

| Signal           || Description               | Comment                                              |
|---------|---------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 3       | SIGQUIT | Quit program              |                                                      |
| 4       | SIGILL  | Illegal instruction       |                                                      |
| 5       | SIGTRAP | Trace trap                |                                                      |
| 6       | SIGABRT | Abort program             |                                                      |
| 8       | SIGFPE  | Floating point exception  | On Intel, integer divide by zero also triggers this. |
| 10      | SIGBUS  | Bus error                 |                                                      |
| 11      | SIGSEGV | Segmentation violation    |                                                      |

If crash catching is enabled, the signal handler will be installed for
any process that links the Swift runtime. If you replace the handlers
for any of these signals, your program will no longer produce backtraces
for program failures that lead to the handler you have replaced.

Additionally, the runtime will configure an alternate signal handling
stack, so that stack overflows can be successfully trapped.

Note that the runtime will not install its signal handlers for a signal
if it finds that there is already a handler for that signal. Similarly
if something else has already configured an alternate signal stack, it
will leave that stack alone.

Once the backtracer has finished handling the crash, it will allow the
crashing program to continue and crash normally, which will result in
the usual Crash Reporter log file being generated.

Crash catching *cannot* be enabled for setuid binaries. This is
intentional as doing so might create a security hole.

### Other Darwin (iOS, tvOS)

Crash catching is not enabled for non-macOS Darwin. You should continue
to look at the system-provided crash logs.
